/* 
 * NOTES
 * Need to use a long to store the final sum.
 *
 * int stores a 32-bit signed two's complement integer; roughly in the range of -2 billion to 2 billion (2^31)
 *
 * The program's dataset are integers up to size 10^10, or 1 billion - we can see the summation of these 
 * integers could quickly surpass the size of a standard int
 *
 * long is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer; roughly in the range of -9*10^18 to 9*10^18 (2^63)
 * 
 * Observe that it would require a dataset of roughly 922 billion integers to exceed this range
